# Substrate v2 — completing the whitepaper, and the Proof-Carrying Memory protocol

> Status: **shipped — all phases P0–P8 landed in v0.5.0** · Owner: forgekit core · Companion to
> [docs/cognitive-substrate/](../../cognitive-substrate/) (the paper this plan completes).
> What remains (deferred, tracked in [ROADMAP.md](../../../ROADMAP.md)): the ledger
> read-path flip (legacy stores still serve reads), the optional embeddings tier
> (ADR-0005), and a Playwright-driven browser loop for the UI gate.

ForgeKit v0.4 implements roughly half of the committed whitepaper — the two prototyped
mechanisms (M1 routing, M2 assumption gate), an approximate impact atlas, and an advisory
memory (cortex + recall). This plan closes the rest, and it closes the pains the paper's
build-opportunity map (§10) ranks highest: validity-anchored memory, outcome-validated
learning, team/shared memory, code reuse, context completeness, doom-loop diagnosis — plus
two pains named by the project owner that the paper only gestures at: **generated-UI
template convergence** and a **~90 % cost-reduction target**.

One idea unifies all of it: the **Proof-Carrying Memory (PCM) protocol**
([01-pcm-protocol.md](./01-pcm-protocol.md)). Every unit of knowledge the system holds —
a lesson, a cached code artifact, a dependency edge, a design fingerprint, a diagnosis —
becomes a _claim_ that carries its own evidence, earns confidence only from independent
oracles (tests, typecheck, CI, human accept/revert), decays without review, and merges
across teammates without conflicts. This takes the paper's sharpest novelty — the `val`
term of Eq. 3, "validity-anchored memory" (§11) — and turns it from one scoring term into
the storage, trust, and wire protocol for the whole substrate.

## 3. Phase roadmap

Phases are dependency-ordered; each has an acceptance gate. P1 is the keystone — every
later phase stores its state as PCM claims. **All phases have shipped** (v0.5.0):

All nodes below are shipped (green); the color is the legend.

| **P4 Context assembly** ✅ | `forge context` — candidate scoring, knapsack selection, required-set completeness gate; wired into `src/substrate.js` + hooks                                                        | P1                         | Gate emits computed missing-set on incomplete context; token budget never exceeded                                   |
| **P5 Loop closure** ✅     | Outcome write-back band; doom-loop diagnosis + escalation; imagination dry-run; M3/M4/M5/M6 extensions                                                                                | P1, P4                     | Revert/test outcomes visibly move `val` of informing claims; repeated failure signature halts with a diagnosis claim |
| **P6 UI quality gate** ✅  | `forge uicheck` v2: design fingerprints, slop distance, scale conformance; machine-readable taste constraints                                                                         | P1                         | Known-template fixture flagged; project-conformant fixture passes; zero LLM calls in the gate                        |
| **P7 Dashboard** ✅        | `forge dash` — local server + self-contained HTML over `.forge/` stores                                                                                                               | P1–P6 (reads their stores) | Renders ledger, cost meter, cache rate, blast radius offline                                                         |
| **P8 Evaluation** ✅       | Extend `src/eval.js`: cost-stage measurement, cache-hit-rate harness, honest report                                                                                                   | P3–P5                      | A measured (not asserted) end-to-end cost figure per stage, published in reports/                                    |

## 4. Honesty register (the paper's own discipline, applied to this plan)

- **Measured:** 62 % routing saving (paper §9, live tokens); atlas recall/precision method
  (paper §8). Everything else in [05-cost-model.md](./05-cost-model.md) is a **target** until
  P8 measures it — the ~90 % figure is a composition argument, not a result.
- **Solved-elsewhere, not rebuilt:** subagent orchestration (M3's mechanics), model
  gateways (M1's plumbing) — per paper §10 "do not rebuild".
- **Research-edge, shipped as advisory first:** consolidation quality (ʿilm→fahm promotion),
  M4 drift similarity, M6 hazard estimates. They enter as advisory signals and only become
  blocking gates once P8 gives them fixtures — the same guard-over-prose discipline as
  ADR-0003.
