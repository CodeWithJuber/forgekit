## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Forge Cortex** — self-correcting project memory. Detects a genuine recurring mistake
  on this repo (test-fail→fix, revert, symbol thrash, explicit human undo), distills a
  structured lesson, and re-confirms it against independent outcomes — with an
  anti-self-reinforcement lifecycle (`Beta` confidence + decay; injection never confirms;
  a green build always wins) so a wrong lesson decays out instead of ossifying.
  `forge cortex`, `forge cortex why <symbol>`.
- Ambient hooks (fail-safe, never block): capture signals during a session, distill at
  `Stop`, inject learned lessons at `SessionStart`, and a `PreToolUse` advisory before a
  risky edit.
- Local error predictor (heuristic + a tiny logistic model) gated by an AUC-PR kill-switch
  — it only ships if it measurably beats the heuristic; otherwise it falls back or disables.
- Cross-tool: lessons inlined into `AGENTS.md` + a zero-dependency MCP server
  (`forge cortex-mcp`, registered in `source/mcp.json`).
- Optional LLM lesson distiller (`ENABLE_CORTEX_DISTILL=1`) — replaces the deterministic
  template with a real distilled lesson via `claude -p`.
- `forge doctor` reports Cortex lesson state; `forge catalog` lists Cortex.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- Cross-tool config emitter (`forge sync`) — one source → each tool's native format; three
  install channels (Claude plugin + marketplace, installer, npm); `forge doctor`; code-graph
  (`atlas`); `lean` discipline; guard/skill/crew layers.
- Verification layer: `forge verify` (tests + hallucinated-symbol catch + provenance),
  doom-loop breaker guard, bias-safe `independent-reviewer` agent.
- Security gate: `forge scan` (skill-gate), `secret-redact` guard, structured
  `permissionDecision` in `protect-paths`, `forge harden` (gitleaks + sandbox).
- Cross-tool MCP emit; portable memory (`forge brain` / `forge remember`); design-taste
  menu (`forge taste`); `forge spec` spec-lock + OpenSpec wiring; MCP ~6-server hygiene
  check; coverage + type-checking (`tsc --checkJs`); 2026 production-standard rules;
  OWASP-LLM / NIST SSDF / SLSA control mapping.
